*This is an inofficial library to interact with the private API of the Jodel App. Not affiliated with The Jodel Venture GmbH. API can change at any time so this library might not work in the future.*

## Usage
Have a look in the examples folder and the source of the library.

It is mainly dependent on the [Python Jodel API of nborrmann](https://github.com/nborrmann/jodel_api). There are some classes which contain helpers and parses to simplify interacting with the API.

Feel free to commit changes and additions like missing methods, tests, docs etc.!
